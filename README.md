👋 Hey there! 
I'm Shahaf, a coding enthusiast hailing from the dynamic city of Tel Aviv, Israel 🌆. 
Besides crafting code, you'll likely spot me riding waves 🏄‍♂️ or engaging in some sports action 🏀. JS and TS are my programming playgrounds, where I tinker with Python on the side 🐍. 
Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! 🔥
